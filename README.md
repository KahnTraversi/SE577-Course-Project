# SE577-Course-Project

Hello there! My name is Michael Kahn, and this is my 3rd term here at Drexel University.

I am persuing an MS in Software Engineering to supplement my Software Engineering career at Boeing.
An area of my career that I wish to develop further is properly structuring and running projects from inception to initial release.
At the moment, most of my career has been focused on developing features for projects that other architects have already designed,
but I know that in order to grow into a better engineer I will need to be capable of designing these projects in the future.
I believe SE577 will not only give me opportunities to practice that (for instance, this project), but will also help me develop a proper
methodology for designing products in the future.

When I am not at work or studying, I run a Dungeons & Dragons table with some of my college friends, and I lead a board game club for some team members at Boeing.
I would consider myself fairly new to the designer board game scene, but I believe my collection has already swelled to a concerning size.
